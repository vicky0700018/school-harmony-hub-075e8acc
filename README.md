https://github.com/vickysosync/school-harmony-hub-ae463b09

es repo mai sara kam pura hai bas check kro kuch remaining to nhi hai es promt ke anusar 

Build a complete, modern, professional and fully functional School Management Portal / School ERP using ONLY:

React

Vite

Tailwind CSS

Do NOT use Next.js.
Do NOT use plain HTML/CSS/Vanilla JavaScript architecture.
Do NOT use unnecessary frameworks or backend technologies.

Use React components, React hooks, Context/API-style service layers and reusable components throughout the application.

For the frontend demo version, use LocalStorage for persistent data. Do NOT use Firebase, Supabase, MySQL, MongoDB or any external database.

The application must be fully responsive and should feel like a real commercial School ERP/SaaS product, not a basic demo.

1. APPLICATION ARCHITECTURE

Create a clean modular React + Vite architecture such as:

src/

components/

layouts/

pages/

modules/

hooks/

context/

services/

utils/

data/

types/

assets/

Sidebar

Topbar

Dashboard Cards

Data Tables

Search

Filters

Pagination

Modal

Forms

Confirmation Dialog

Toast Notifications

Dropdowns
